% The following fields are related to appearance of plots
%  flag_visible = 1 to show axis; 0 not to
%  view = 'xyz','xy','xz','yz' or (1,3) array, solo for 3-d
%  linewidth = line width for mesh
%  markersize_node = size of dots indicating locations
%  markersize_arrow = size of dot representing dof
%  stretch = scalar multiplier to adjust magnitude of deformed shape
%  flag_movie = 1 to produce movie; 0 to provide static figures
%               avi file can be produced from o.M, e.g.,
%               movie2avi(o.M,'mymovie')
%  flag_avi = 1 to produce avi file
%  avi = char of avi file name
%  fps = frames per second, used only when flag_movie = 1
%  color_ch = char or cell array of color for arrows showing channels
%             char => same for all channels; if cell dim. is less than no.
%             of channels, it will be replicated. 
%             Remember to put {color_ch} so that the input structure has a 
%             cell as its field rather than being an array of structures
%  
%  color_rep = no. of row-wise replications of color_ch
%            E.g., suppose there are 3 biaxial sensors, with channels
%            x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,3. Then setting
%            color_rep = 2 will show the two dofs measured by sensor 1 in 
%            blue, sensor 2 in green and senosr 3 in red.
%  arrow_width = line width of arrow showing measured dofs
%  aspect = cell, input to aspect(:)
%  flag_ch_txt = 1 to show channel no.; 0 not to
%  flag_node_txt = 1 to show node number next to node; 0 not to
%  flag_setup_txt = 1 to show setup number next to node measured; 0 not to
%  flag_holdon = 1 to accumulate setups (hold on); 0 not to (hold off)
%                if flag_movie = 0, this also means that all setups will be
%                shown in a single setup
%  flag_tick = 1 to show ticks on axis; 0 not to
%  fontsize_ch = font size of ch. no.
%  fontsize_node = fontsize of node number
%  fontsize_setup = fontsize of setup text
